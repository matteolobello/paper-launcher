# Paper Launcher

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OhMyLob/Paper-Launcher/master/art/video.gif)
<br>
This is an Android Launcher app based on Eduardo Pratti's mockup and made from scratch.
<br>
The Launcher is only tested on my device (Nexus 5X running Android Oreo 8.0), but should work on <b>every</b> Android Lollipop+ phone.
<br>
The launcher doesn't include much customization, you can only change wallpaper, the dock icons and the Icon Pack, as it's only been an experiment to me, trying to do my best with smooth <b>animation</b> and <b>transitions</b>, bringing a new <b>modern</b> look to my phone.
<br>
The second dock that appears when you slide on the first dock or open the App drawer is <b>dynamic</b> and brings your <b>most launched apps</b> always visible.
<br>
The app includes <b>Homescreen gestures</b>, swipe up to open the App drawer, swipe down to expand the StatusBar
<br>
Android Nougat 7.1 <b>Shortcuts</b> are supported with a new layout that uses the Material BottomSheet component.
<br>
All the design part is made by <b>Eduardo Pratti</b>, thank you Eduardo!
